<h2>Jonesboro Pool Center</h2>
<h4>1421 East Nettelton, Jonesboro AR 72401</h4>
<p>

The city of Jonesboro was holding meetings regarding the only city pool, which was located at the <br>
Earl Bell Community Center. The pool at the Church street location was in need of some very costly <br>
repairs, and decisions were needed quickly with summer approaching fast. In 2012 when the YMCA had <br>
formally announced it would be closing its facility, the city decided it would be more cost effective <br>
to purchase the YMCA facility. The pool underwent a remodel in the early spring of 2013 and was <br>
formally re-named The Jonesboro Pool Center. It is located at 1421 West Nettelton. The Jonesboro Pool <br>
Center opens Memorial Day week-end of each year and is open through Labor Day week-end each year. Long <br>
range planning continues for the Jonesboro Pool Center facility.<br><br>
•	Pool reservations are available for private parties<br>
•	Optimist park adjacent to pool center<br>
•	Lighted facility<br>
•	Paved parking<br>
•	Concessions<br>
•	Soccer/football practice fields<br>
