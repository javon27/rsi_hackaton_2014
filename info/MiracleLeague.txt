Miracle League of Jonesboro
5000 South Caraway Road, Jonesboro AR 72404

The Miracle League Ball Field has been a long time inception of the Southside Softball Coordinator. Sharon Turman presented a PowerPoint pitch to Jonesboro’s mayor, Harold Perrin, who immediately was on board with Ms. Truman’s field of dreams. There are several Miracle Leagues across the US. Jonesboro’s Miracle League will be the largest of its kind in Arkansas. Within the complex will also be a Miracle League playground, as well as ADA compliant parking and walkways. The Miracle League Ball Fields are designed for children and adults who are physically and mentally challenged. Currently, the land is owned by the Department of Human Services of Arkansas and the city has a 50-year lease.
