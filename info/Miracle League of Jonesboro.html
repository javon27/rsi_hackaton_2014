<h2>Miracle League of Jonesboro</h2>
<h2>Miracle League Park is currently under construction, so there are no photos of the park.</h2>
<h4>5000 South Caraway Road, Jonesboro AR 72404</h4>
<p>

The Miracle League Ball Field has been a long time inception of the Southside Softball Coordinator. <br>
Sharon Turman presented a PowerPoint pitch to Jonesboro’s mayor, Harold Perrin, who immediately was on <br>
board with Ms. Truman’s field of dreams. There are several Miracle Leagues across the US. Jonesboro’s <br>
Miracle League will be the largest of its kind in Arkansas. Within the complex will also be a Miracle <br>
League playground, as well as ADA compliant parking and walkways. The Miracle League Ball Fields are <br>
designed for children and adults who are physically and mentally challenged. Currently, the land is <br>
owned by the Department of Human Services of Arkansas and the city has a 50-year lease.<br><br>
