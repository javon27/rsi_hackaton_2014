Jonesboro Pool Center
1421 East Nettelton, Jonesboro AR 72401

The city of Jonesboro was holding meetings regarding the only city pool, which was located at the Earl Bell Community Center. The pool at the Church street location was in need of some very costly repairs, and decisions were needed quickly with summer approaching fast. In 2012 when the YMCA had formally announced it would be closing its facility, the city decided it would be more cost effective to purchase the YMCA facility. The pool underwent a remodel in the early spring of 2013 and was formally re-named The Jonesboro Pool Center. It is located at 1421 West Nettelton. The Jonesboro Pool Center opens Memorial Day week-end of each year and is open through Labor Day week-end each year. Long range planning continues for the Jonesboro Pool Center facility.
