<p>

The Herbert J. Parker family has been proud to call Jonesboro their home. In the spring of 1994, <br>
the Parker family decided to give back to the community that served them well. The Parkers donated 4.3 <br>
acres of land to the city they so dearly called home in hopes that a park and playground would be <br>
developed. In the year 2000, the city of Jonesboro constructed a community center that would bear the <br>
Parker Name. The Parker Park Community Center offers the following amenities:<br><br>
•	Pavilion<br>
•	Picnic area<br>
•	Restrooms<br>
•	Play-grounds<br>
•	Lighted practice fields<br>
•	Walking track<br>
•	Splash pad<br>
•	Community center with a conference room, a catering kitchen, and a gymnasium available for renting<br>
